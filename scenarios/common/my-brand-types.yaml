#
# Mock types from Open-O catalog.
#
# In the real catalog these will be actual VNF products, pacakaged via
# the VNOB (VNF On-Boarding process). Each package will include
# detailed metadata, including TOSCA type definitions to be imported
# by the blueprint, and scripts or other plugins that perform the
# lifecycle operations.
#
# These are merely mock types with no actual implementations.
