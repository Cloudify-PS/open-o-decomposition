    open-o.GenericEnterpriseRouter:
        description: |
            A generic physical Ethernet TCP/IP router (wired and/or
            WiFi) that sits at the customer's enterprise LANs (CPE:
            Customer Premises Equipment).
            
            For the purposes of NFV, we care only about its ability
            to function as the egde of a forwarding graph, via the
            "uplink" endpoint.
            
            In some cases, the responsibility for configuring the router
            is with the customer, in which case the uplink would be
            provided as an input to the blueprint. However, in other
            cases the customer may provide us with a management entry
            point allowing us to configure the uplink remotely, likely
            via an HTTP or SSH interface. This would happen by
            configuring its IP routing table, via the "configure"
            operation on the tosca.interfaces.node.lifecycle.Standard
            interface using the included properties.
            
            This generic type should be sub-classed to support the
            various brands and models of routers supported by the
            carrier, as each will likely require its own specialized
            configuration scripts.

    open-o.VirtualRouter:
        description: |
            Base type for virtual TCP/IP routers.
            
            For the purpose of NFV, they provide two or more virtual
            links, allowing them to serve as nodes within a forwarding
            graph.
            
            These are often useful for adding an extra "hop" at the PoP
            behind a physical router (CPE) that sits at the customer's
            premise. Because this virtual router in entirely under our
            control we can here control all routing for the customer.
            
            This generic type should be sub-classed to support the
            various brands and models of virtual routers in the
            Open-O catalog. This generic type provides two virtual
            links, but real products may provide more than two link
            with complex routing configurations.

    open-o.VirtualFirewall:
        description: |
            Base type for dedicated virtual TCP/IP firewalls.
            
            For the purpose of NFV, they function as a passthrough node
            within a forwarding graph, and thus always provide two virtual
            links (incoming and outgoing).
            
            Often used for providing security and isolation for
            enterprise customers at the PoP.
